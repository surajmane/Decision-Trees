# Decision-Trees
Text messages classification as spam or not spam using Decision trees classification algorithm

Dataset contains 5572 records of labeled data of text messages. Divided into two columns namely label(Spam or ham) and the message.
There are no null or missing values in the data.
It was split in 8:2 ratio where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for testing.

# What was gathered
The maximum accuracy using Decision trees achieved was 97% which is lesser than what I got using Naive Bayes by 1%. Used Entropy as the splitting criteria for the algorithm.
